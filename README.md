## Usage

### Prerequisites
- GNU Make
- GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)

### File Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `.gitignore`: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by version control.
- `Makefile`: The build script for compiling the project.
- `README.md`: This file, providing information about the project.
- `functions.c`: Source file containing the implementation of functions used in the project.
- `functions.h`: Header file declaring the functions used in the project.
- `main.c`: Source file containing the main function and user interface of the calendar project.

## Compilation and Execution

### Step 2: Compiling the Project

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
2. Run the following command to compile the project:
  make

### Step 3: Executing the Project
